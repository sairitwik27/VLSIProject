# VLSIProject
This was part of my 5th sem Lab Project. I had initially started off with a plan to make an 8 bit ALU, however I changed directions and made a 4bit Vedic Multiplier instead. Both of those are included in the repository. You need Magic for layout, irsim for simulation, Netgen for testing. There can still be improvements in the final layout,however I have kept it the way it was earlier.
