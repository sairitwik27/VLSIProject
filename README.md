# VLSIProject
This was part of my 5th sem Lab Project. I had initially started off with a plan to make an 8 bit ALU, however I changed directions and made a 4bit Vedic Multiplier instead. You need Magic for layout, irsim for simulation, Netgen for testing. There can still be improvements in the final layout,howver I have kept it the way it was earlier.
